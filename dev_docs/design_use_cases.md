This document defines the core user questions and workflows that drive the Music Theory Toolkit design. Each use case maps to specific features in the application.

## üéº Mode Identification
**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ Complete with enhanced features ([see implementation](./implementation.md#phase-1-core-navigation--mode-identification-complete))

1. What mode is this melody in?
2. What mode is this scale or note collection?
3. What modes are possible with these notes and this tonic/root?
4. What modes fit this chord progression?
5. Is this scale modal or tonal?

‚∏ª

## üîç Mode Discovery
**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ Complete UI, backend integration pending ([see implementation](./implementation.md#phase-2-mode-discovery--enhanced-scale-tables-complete))

6. What modes can I build from this root note?
7. What modes contain these specific notes?
8. What are the diatonic modes of the [C major / G minor / etc.] scale?
9. What are the modes of the melodic/harmonic minor scale?
10. What‚Äôs the difference between Dorian and Aeolian (or any two modes)?

## üéµ Chords & Harmonic Application
**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ Complete UI, backend integration pending ([see implementation](./implementation.md#phase-3-chords--harmony-complete))

11. What chords can I use in this mode?
12. What chords can I substitute for [chord X] in this key or mode?
13. What mode fits over this chord or chord progression?
14. Which mode works over a dominant 7#11 chord?
15. Can I use modal interchange here? From which modes?
16. What chords in this progression are modal and what are their modes?

BELOW IS FOR LATER -- ONLY ADVANCED. IGNORE BELOW HERE.

## üß† Theory Clarification
16. What is a mode, and how is it different from a scale or key?
17. What are the characteristics or ‚Äòcolor‚Äô of each mode?
18. How do modes relate to the major scale?
19. What is the parent scale of this mode?
20. How do I know when a song is in a mode instead of a key?

---

## üéπ Improvisation & Composition
21. Which mode should I use to write a darker/brighter melody?
22. What mode should I use to solo over this chord progression?
23. How do I use modes in jazz/improv/metal/etc.?
24. How do modes change the feel of a melody or harmony?

---

## üß© Edge Case / Advanced Questions
25. What mode is this if it contains both a b6 and a natural 7?
26. Can two modes share the same notes but have different tonics?
27. How do I recognize modal modulation in a piece of music?
28. How do enharmonic spellings affect modal interpretation?
29. Is this mode derived from a major scale, melodic minor, or another system (like Hungarian, Neapolitan, etc.)?
