## Background & Context

This document tracks the implementation status of the Music Theory Toolkit redesign project. The goal is to transform the app from a tool-centric layout to a user-centric, question-driven interface that directly addresses common music theory use cases.

> **üîó Related Documents**: 
> - **User Workflows**: See [use cases](./design_use_cases.md) for the 29 user questions driving development priorities
> - **Design Specifications**: See [design requirements](./design_requirements.md) for UI/UX requirements being implemented
> - **Technical Architecture**: See [architecture](./architecture.md) for system design and component structure

### Project Overview
- **Original State**: Two separate components (ChordAnalyzer + ScaleFinder) with tool-centric layout
- **Target State**: Question-driven navigation with 4 main tabs addressing specific user workflows
- **Architecture**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Vite
- **Key Services**: Gemini AI integration, MIDI input, scale/chord analysis

### Design Philosophy
The redesign follows a question-driven approach where users start with what they want to know:
- "What mode is this?" ‚Üí Mode Identification
- "What modes can I build?" ‚Üí Mode Discovery  
- "What chords work together?" ‚Üí Chords & Harmony
- "Show me scale references" ‚Üí Reference Tables
