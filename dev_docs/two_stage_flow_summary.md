# Two-Stage Flow Implementation Summary

## Overview

Updated the "Build from Root" functionality to use a two-stage interaction flow instead of immediately opening the unified results panel.

## Changes Made to Documentation

### 1. Design Requirements (`design_requirements.md`)

**Updated Mode Discovery Tab section:**
- Added two-stage flow description for "Build from Root"
- Created detailed UI mockup showing immediate results layout
- Described Stage 1 (immediate results) and Stage 2 (deeper analysis) interactions

**Key Changes:**
- Stage 1: Immediate results display below note selector on same screen
- Stage 2: "Deeper Analysis" links next to each mode for unified results panel with sample songs
- Visual mockup showing compact mode cards with analysis buttons

### 2. Implementation Documentation (`implementation.md`)

**Updated Build from Root section:**
- Replaced "Re-Architecture Plan" with "Two-Stage Flow Plan"
- Added comprehensive technical implementation details
- Created 5-phase implementation plan

**Key Technical Changes:**
- ModeDiscoveryTab component updates for inline results
- ScaleGrid component enhancements for deeper analysis buttons
- Unified results integration for Stage 2 analysis
- Styling and UX improvements

## New User Flow

### Current Flow (Before)
1. User selects root note
2. Clicks "Discover" button
3. Unified results panel opens immediately
4. User sees comprehensive analysis

### New Flow (After)
1. User clicks a root note
2. **Immediate results appear below note selector on same screen**
3. User sees compact mode cards with basic info
4. **Optional**: User clicks "Deeper Analysis" on specific mode
5. Unified results panel opens with comprehensive analysis + song examples

## Benefits
