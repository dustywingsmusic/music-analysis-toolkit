# Music Theory Toolkit - Development Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Music Theory Toolkit project, organized to provide a clear path from user needs to implementation.

## 📋 Documentation Overview

The documentation follows a logical flow that ties **use cases** → **requirements** → **design** → **development** → **specialized guides**:

```
🎯 User Needs → 📋 Requirements → 🎨 Design → 💻 Implementation → 🎛️ Specialized Guides
```

  - Client-side SPA architecture
  - Component hierarchy and data flow
  - **Unified Results Display Architecture** (state management, history, positioning)
  - Service layer integration
  - External API connections
- **Links to**: Requirements (what to build) → Implementation (current status)
- **Next**: See development progress in `implementation.md`

### 4. 💻 [implementation.md](./implementation.md)
**Current development status and implementation plan**

- **Purpose**: Tracks development progress and provides implementation context
- **Content**: Phase-by-phase completion status, technical details, next steps
- **Current Status**: 80% complete with full Mode Identification and Enhanced Analysis Results Panel implementation
- **Key Sections**:
  - Phase completion tracking
  - **Unified Results Display implementation tasks** (history, positioning, cross-tab access)
  - Backend integration status
  - Testing strategy and commands
  - Priority roadmap
- **Links to**: Architecture (technical design) → Use cases (user validation)

### 5. 🎛️ [analysis_results_panel.md](./analysis_results_panel.md)
**Specialized implementation guide for the enhanced analysis results panel**

- **Purpose**: Detailed requirements and implementation for the dismissible companion analysis panel
- **Content**: Enhanced UI patterns, state management, and responsive behavior specifications
- **Key Sections**:
  - Dismissible companion panel architecture
  - Enhanced state management patterns
  - Visual design enhancements with smooth transitions
  - Mobile-responsive drawer behavior
  - Implementation roadmap (4 phases)
- **Links to**: Extends implementation.md with specialized analysis panel details
- **Next**: Use for implementing the enhanced analysis results panel features

## 🔄 How Documents Connect

### Use Case → Requirement → Implementation Flow

1. **User Question** (use_cases.md): *"What mode is this melody?"*
2. **Design Requirement** (design_requirements.md): *"Melody Input: Note sequence input (MIDI or manual)"*
3. **Technical Design** (architecture.md): *"ModeIdentificationTab Component with Method Selector"*
4. **Implementation Status** (implementation.md): *"✅ COMPLETE - Melody analysis with enhanced processing"*

### Cross-Reference Examples

- **Use Case 1** ("What mode is this melody?") → **Design Req 3** (Mode Identification Tab) → **Architecture Component** (ModeIdentificationTab) → **Implementation Phase 1** (Complete)
- **Use Case 6** ("What modes can I build from this root?") → **Design Req 3** (Mode Discovery Tab) → **Architecture Component** (ModeDiscoveryTab) → **Implementation Phase 2** (Complete)

## 🎯 Quick Navigation

### For New Developers
1. Start with [design_use_cases.md](./design_use_cases.md) to understand user needs
2. Review [architecture.md](./architecture.md) for technical overview
3. Check [implementation.md](./implementation.md) for current status
4. For analysis panel work, see [analysis_results_panel.md](./analysis_results_panel.md) for detailed specifications

### For Product/Design
1. Review [design_use_cases.md](./design_use_cases.md) for user workflows
2. Examine [design_requirements.md](./design_requirements.md) for UI/UX specifications
3. Validate against [implementation.md](./implementation.md) for what's built

### For Project Management
1. Check [implementation.md](./implementation.md) for completion status
2. Review [design_requirements.md](./design_requirements.md) for scope
3. Reference [design_use_cases.md](./design_use_cases.md) for user value
