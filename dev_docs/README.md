# Music Theory Toolkit - Development Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Music Theory Toolkit project, organized to provide a clear path from user needs to implementation.

## 📋 Documentation Overview

The documentation follows a logical flow that ties **use cases** → **requirements** → **design** → **development** → **specialized guides**:

```
🎯 User Needs → 📋 Requirements → 🎨 Design → 💻 Implementation → 🎛️ Specialized Guides
```

## 🔄 How Documents Connect

### Use Case → Requirement → Implementation Flow

1. **User Question** (use_cases.md): *"What mode is this melody?"*
2. **Design Requirement** (design_requirements.md): *"Melody Input: Note sequence input (MIDI or manual)"*
3. **Technical Design** (architecture.md): *"ModeIdentificationTab Component with Method Selector"*
4. **Implementation Status** (implementation.md): *"✅ COMPLETE - Melody analysis with enhanced processing"*

### Cross-Reference Examples

- **Use Case 1** ("What mode is this melody?") → **Design Req 3** (Mode Identification Tab) → **Architecture Component** (ModeIdentificationTab) → **Implementation Phase 1** (Complete)
- **Use Case 6** ("What modes can I build from this root?") → **Design Req 3** (Mode Discovery Tab) → **Architecture Component** (ModeDiscoveryTab) → **Implementation Phase 2** (Complete)

## 🗺️ UI Location Mapping

**✨ NEW FEATURE**: All documentation now includes specific UI location mapping to help users and developers quickly find features in the application.
