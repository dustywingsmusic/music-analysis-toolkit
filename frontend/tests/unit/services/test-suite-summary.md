## Key Test Scenarios Covered

### Critical Cases from Requirements
1. **B-D progression**: Tests V/V-V secondary dominant identification
2. **G-F-C-G modal progression**: Tests with and without parent key context
3. **Parent Key + Local Tonic**: Validates the core modal analysis architecture
4. **All 67 dataset cases**: Comprehensive validation against expected outputs

### Testing Categories
- Basic Functional Progressions (I-IV-V-I, ii-V-I, etc.)
- Cadences (authentic, plagal, deceptive, half)
- Modal Analysis (Mixolydian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Aeolian)
- Secondary Dominants (V/V, V/ii, V/iii, V/vi)
- Borrowed Chords (bVI, iv, bVII from parallel keys)
- Chromatic Mediants (III, bVI relationships)
- Jazz Harmony (complex progressions with 7th chords)
- Ambiguous Cases (multiple valid interpretations)
- Context-Dependent Analysis (same progression, different keys)
- Edge Cases (single chords, Neapolitan chords, tritone relationships)

## Test Results Analysis

### Current Status
The tests are comprehensive but many are failing because:

1. **Services Not Fully Implemented**: The FunctionalHarmonyAnalyzer and ComprehensiveAnalysisEngine may not exist or be incomplete
2. **Interface Mismatches**: Expected interfaces may not match actual implementations
3. **Missing Functionality**: Some advanced features (secondary dominants, borrowed chords) may not be implemented yet

### Pass/Fail Breakdown
- **112 tests passed**: Basic functionality is working
- **95 tests failed**: Advanced features need implementation
- **12% pass rate on comprehensive dataset**: Indicates significant implementation gaps

### Key Areas Needing Implementation

1. **FunctionalHarmonyAnalyzer**:
   - Secondary dominant detection (V/V, V/ii, etc.)
   - Borrowed chord identification
   - Chromatic element analysis
   - Advanced Roman numeral notation

2. **ComprehensiveAnalysisEngine**:
   - Primary approach selection logic
   - Modal enhancement evaluation
   - Multi-perspective coordination

3. **Enhanced Chord Parsing**:
   - Better chord symbol recognition
   - 7th chord handling
   - Enharmonic equivalents

## Expected Performance Metrics

### Accuracy Targets
- **90% pass rate** on comprehensive dataset
- **85% accuracy** per category
- **80% accuracy** for primary approach identification
- **85% accuracy** for secondary dominant detection
- **80% accuracy** for borrowed chord detection

### Performance Targets
- **<50ms** average processing time per test case
- **<200ms** for complex jazz progressions
- **<500ms** for end-to-end hybrid analysis

### Confidence Scoring Targets
- **80% of cases** within expected confidence ranges
- **90% of clear cases** with high confidence (>0.8)
- **70% of ambiguous cases** with appropriate lower confidence (<0.8)

## Next Steps

### 1. Service Implementation
Implement or complete the core services to match the test interfaces:
- FunctionalHarmonyAnalyzer with full Roman numeral analysis
- ComprehensiveAnalysisEngine with multi-perspective coordination
- Enhanced chord parsing and chromatic element detection

### 2. Incremental Testing
Run tests incrementally as features are implemented:
```bash
# Test individual services
npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/services/functionalHarmonyAnalysis.test.ts

# Test specific categories
npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/services/ --grep "Basic Functional"

# Full validation
npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/services/comprehensive-dataset-validation.test.ts
```

### 3. Test-Driven Development
Use the failing tests as a roadmap for implementation:
1. Start with basic functional progressions
2. Add secondary dominant detection
3. Implement borrowed chord analysis
4. Add modal enhancement logic
5. Integrate all components

## Test Suite Value

This comprehensive test suite provides:

1. **Requirements Validation**: Ensures all 67 test cases are handled correctly
2. **Regression Prevention**: Catches issues when making changes
3. **Implementation Guide**: Failing tests show exactly what needs to be built
4. **Quality Assurance**: Validates theoretical accuracy and performance
5. **Documentation**: Tests serve as examples of expected behavior

The test suite is ready to guide the implementation of a theoretically sound, comprehensive music theory analysis framework that handles functional harmony, modal analysis, and chromatic harmony with high accuracy and appropriate confidence scoring.
