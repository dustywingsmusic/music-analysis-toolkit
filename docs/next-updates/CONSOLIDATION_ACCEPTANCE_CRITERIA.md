# Consolidation Acceptance Criteria: Enhanced Smart Analysis

## Overview

This document defines the complete acceptance criteria for **Consolidation Option 1: Enhanced Smart Analysis**, which merges Live Suggestions functionality into Smart Analysis Results to create a unified, progressive disclosure interface.

## üéØ Core Consolidation Requirements

### AC1: Single Analysis Interface
- **GIVEN** a user interacts with MIDI input
- **WHEN** musical analysis is triggered
- **THEN** only one consolidated "Musical Analysis" section should be visible in the sidebar
- **AND** the separate "Live Suggestions" section should be removed
- **AND** all functionality from both sections should be preserved in the unified interface

**Implementation Notes**:
- Remove lines 635-732 from `IntegratedMusicSidebar.tsx` (Live Suggestions section)
- Rename "üéØ Smart Analysis Results" to "üéØ Musical Analysis"
- Ensure all callback functionality is preserved

### AC2: Progressive Disclosure Implementation
- **GIVEN** the consolidated Musical Analysis section
- **WHEN** a user first views the analysis
- **THEN** a "Quick View" should be displayed by default showing:
  - Top 3 immediate suggestions
  - Simple confidence indicators (percentage completeness)
  - One-click "View in Tables" functionality
- **AND** a "Show Details" or expandable control should be available
- **WHEN** the user expands to detailed view
- **THEN** the full Smart Analysis categorization should be shown:
  - Complete categorized results (Complete Scale Match, Pentatonic/Hexatonic, etc.)
  - Enhanced metrics and match type indicators
  - Advanced options and controls

**Implementation Notes**:
- Add CSS classes: `.progressive-disclosure-controls`, `.show-more-btn`, `.toggle-analysis-btn`
- Implement view mode state management
- Ensure smooth transitions between views

### AC3: Adaptive Behavior Based on Context (UPDATED)
- **GIVEN** different types of musical input
- **WHEN** the system detects:
  - 1-2 notes: Show Quick View with broad discovery suggestions
  - 3-4 notes: Show Quick View with chord and partial scale suggestions
  - **5-6 notes: Show Quick View with pentatonic/hexatonic suggestions FIRST, followed by complete scale suggestions ranked lower due to lower completeness**
  - 7+ notes: Auto-expand to Detailed View with complete scale analysis
- **THEN** the interface should automatically choose the appropriate detail level
- **AND** for 5-6 note input, the results should be ordered as follows:
  1. **Primary Results**: Pentatonic/hexatonic matches (higher completeness percentage)
  2. **Secondary Results**: Complete scale matches (lower completeness percentage, clearly marked as "less complete")
- **AND** users should be able to manually override the automatic behavior

**Implementation Notes**:
- Update `analyzePentatonicHexatonic()` function in `keySuggester.ts`
- Implement proper sorting by completeness percentage
- Add visual indicators for match priority

### AC4: Unified Data Flow
- **GIVEN** the consolidated interface
- **WHEN** MIDI input is processed
- **THEN** both quick suggestions and detailed analysis should use the same underlying `updateUnifiedDetection()` function

  1. **Match completeness** (pentatonic/hexatonic matches shown first with higher completeness percentages)
  2. **Match type relevance** (pentatonic > complete scales for 5-6 note input)
  3. **User's current analysis focus setting**
- **AND** complete scale suggestions should be clearly labeled with lower completeness indicators
- **AND** each suggestion should show a simple confidence indicator

## üîÑ Key Changes Summary

**Primary Updates from Original AC**:
- **AC3, AC6, AC14, AC16, AC17**: Enhanced 5-6 note analysis logic with proper pentatonic/hexatonic prioritization
- **AC18**: New requirement for missing CSS implementation
- **AC19**: New accessibility compliance requirement
- **AC20**: New code quality requirement

**Critical Success Factors**:
1. **Musical Accuracy**: Pentatonic/hexatonic matches must rank higher than incomplete scale matches for 5-6 note input
2. **Visual Clarity**: Users must understand why certain suggestions rank higher
3. **Performance**: No degradation in response time or memory usage
4. **Accessibility**: Full compliance with accessibility standards
5. **User Experience**: Smooth transition from current dual-section interface

This ensures that as users add more notes, the results become more specific and accurate, with the most complete matches (pentatonic/hexatonic for 5-6 notes) appearing prominently while still providing complete scale options for reference.
