# Music Theory Integration Roadmap

## Phase 1 Implementation Status âœ…

### Local Chord Progression Analysis
**File**: `/src/services/localChordProgressionAnalysis.ts`
- Replaces AI-dependent analysis with theoretically accurate local algorithms
- Uses existing `chordLogic.ts` templates for chord identification
- Integrates `realTimeModeDetection.ts` for modal context
- Roman numeral analysis and chord function identification
- Modal characteristics and borrowed chord detection
- Confidence scores based on theoretical accuracy

### Unified Analysis Context
**File**: `/src/contexts/AnalysisContext.tsx`
- Shared state management across all analysis features
- Unified analysis state persisting across tabs
- Support for different input types (melody, chord_progression, scale, midi_realtime)
- Cross-feature navigation with pending navigation handling
- Analysis history and reference connections
- User preferences for local vs AI analysis priority

### Hybrid Analysis Service
**File**: `/src/services/hybridAnalysisService.ts`
- **Local Analysis First**: Primary analysis using existing algorithms
- **AI Enhancement**: Contextual information and song examples
- **Cross-Validation**: Compares local and AI results for accuracy
- **Timeout Handling**: Prevents AI failures from blocking analysis
- **Extensible**: Ready for melody and scale analysis integration

### Enhanced Harmony Tab
**File**: `/src/components/EnhancedHarmonyTab.tsx`
- Demonstrates new analysis approach in UI
- Local-first analysis with AI enhancement
- Cross-validation results display
- Better error handling and fallbacks

## Architecture Principles

### Local-First Approach
- Core analysis functions work without external dependencies
- AI enhancement provides context, not core functionality
- Fallback gracefully when AI services unavailable
- Fast, reliable analysis using established music theory

### Integration Strategy
- Build on existing codebase strengths
- Maintain compatibility with current components
- Progressive enhancement rather than replacement
- Extensible foundation for future features

### User Experience
- Instant analysis feedback (no waiting for AI)
- Enhanced context when AI available
- Cross-validation builds user confidence
- Seamless fallback during AI service issues

## Next Phase Considerations
- Melody and scale analysis integration
- Advanced modal analysis features
- Real-time collaborative analysis
- Educational mode with guided learning
