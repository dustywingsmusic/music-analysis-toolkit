## üîÑ Recent Major Updates

### Music Theory Validation & Integration Plan
Based on comprehensive music theory validation analysis, the documentation has been updated to reflect critical issues with current AI-dependent features and the strategic plan to integrate the Reference section's sophisticated analysis capabilities throughout the application.

### Key Changes Made:
1. **TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md**: Updated roadmap with critical integration priorities
2. **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md**: Added Music Theory Integration implementation guide  
3. **DESIGN_AND_REQUIREMENTS.md**: Identified features requiring redesign with clear priorities
4. **DEPLOYMENT_AND_OPERATIONS.md**: Added architecture evolution monitoring notice
5. **NEW: MUSIC_THEORY_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md**: Comprehensive strategic plan

### Integration Priority Summary:
- **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Chord progression analysis redesign, shared analysis context
- **Phase 2 (4-8 weeks)**: Modal context analysis, Roman numeral analysis engine  
- **Phase 3 (8-16 weeks)**: Educational integration and progressive learning features
