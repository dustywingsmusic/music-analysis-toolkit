# Contextual Help System Design

## Overview
Sophisticated contextual help system enhancing music theory learning through progressive disclosure and contextual relevance without overwhelming the interface.

## Design Philosophy
**"Just-in-time learning with contextual relevance"**

- **Non-intrusive**: Help appears only when requested
- **Context-aware**: Explanations adapt to current analysis type and results
- **Progressive**: Multiple depth levels from quick reference to detailed explanations
- **Educational**: Focuses on building understanding, not just definitions
- **Mobile-friendly**: Touch-optimized interactions for all devices

## Component Architecture
```
ContextualHelpProvider (Context Provider)
├── MusicTermHighlighter (Wrapper Component)
│   ├── TooltipContent (Quick definitions)
│   ├── DetailModal (In-depth explanations)
│   └── RelatedConcepts (Cross-references)
├── HelpGlossary (Knowledge Base)
├── ContextAnalyzer (Context-aware content)
└── HelpTrigger (Interaction handler)
```

## Key Features

### Progressive Disclosure
1. **Hover**: Quick definition tooltip
2. **Click**: Detailed explanation modal
3. **Deep Dive**: Related concepts and examples
4. **Practice**: Interactive exercises (future enhancement)

### Context Awareness
- **Analysis Type**: Different explanations for modal vs functional analysis
- **User Level**: Adapt complexity based on user experience
- **Current Results**: Relevant examples from user's actual analysis
- **Learning Path**: Sequential concept building

### Music Theory Concepts Covered
- **Modal Analysis**: Modes, parent keys, local tonics
- **Functional Harmony**: Roman numerals, chord functions
- **Chord Symbols**: Reading chord symbols and extensions
- **Scale Theory**: Scale degrees, intervals, relationships
- **MIDI Integration**: Technical concepts made accessible

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core System
- Basic tooltip system for key terms
- Simple glossary with common music theory terms
- Context detection for current analysis type

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Interactive examples within tooltips
- Audio playback for chord/scale examples
- Learning progress tracking

### Phase 3: Personalization
- Adaptive complexity based on user knowledge
- Customizable help preferences
- Learning path recommendations

## User Experience Guidelines
- Help should feel like a knowledgeable friend, not a textbook
- Examples should relate to the user's current musical context
- Avoid overwhelming beginners while providing depth for experts
- Clear visual hierarchy between quick help and detailed explanations

## Accessibility Considerations
- Keyboard navigation for all help interactions
- Screen reader support for all help content
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Respect user motion preferences for animations
