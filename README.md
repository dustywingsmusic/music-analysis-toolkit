## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.2.0
- **AI Service**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (CDN-based, no build required)
- **Music Libraries**: WebMIDI API for MIDI input, ABCjs for music notation
- **Additional**: PostCSS with Autoprefixer for enhanced CSS processing

## Tailwind CSS Setup

This project uses a **no-build approach** for Tailwind CSS, which means you can start developing immediately without waiting for CSS compilation. Here's how it works:

### CDN-Based Implementation
- Tailwind CSS is loaded directly from CDN via `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`
- No separate build step required for CSS processing
- Instant development with real-time style updates

### Configuration
The Tailwind configuration is embedded directly in `index.html`:
```javascript
tailwind.config = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animation: {
        'fade-in': 'fadeIn 0.5s ease-in-out',
      },
      keyframes: {
        fadeIn: {
          '0%': { opacity: '0' },
          '100%': { opacity: '1' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Custom Styles
Custom component styles are defined using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a `<style type="text/tailwindcss">` block in `index.html`. This approach provides:
- **Component-based styling**: Reusable CSS classes like `.btn`, `.card`, `.section-title`
- **Consistent design system**: Unified color palette and spacing
- **Dark theme optimization**: Slate color scheme optimized for extended use
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive utilities

### Benefits of This Approach
- ‚ö° **Instant startup**: No CSS build time during development
- üîÑ **Hot reloading**: Immediate style updates without compilation
- üì¶ **Zero configuration**: Works out of the box
- üé® **Full Tailwind features**: Access to all utilities and responsive design
- üõ†Ô∏è **Easy customization**: Direct configuration in HTML
