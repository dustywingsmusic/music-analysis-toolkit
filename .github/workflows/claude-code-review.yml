            Please review this pull request for the Music Modes App, focusing on:

            **Code Quality & Standards:**
            - TypeScript usage and type safety (frontend)
            - Python code quality (backend) - Black, isort, flake8, mypy compliance
            - ESLint compliance and modern React patterns
            - Pre-commit hook compatibility

            **Music Theory & Domain-Specific:**
            - Accuracy of music theory calculations and algorithms
            - MIDI handling and audio processing correctness
            - Modal analysis and chord progression logic
            - Educational value and user experience for music students/educators

            **Testing & Quality:**
            - Test coverage for new features (unit, component, E2E)
            - MIDI-related testing considerations
            - Cross-browser compatibility (especially for Web MIDI API)
            - Performance implications for real-time audio processing

            **Security & Performance:**
            - Security vulnerabilities (especially file uploads, user input)
            - Performance considerations for audio/MIDI processing
            - Memory leaks in audio contexts or MIDI connections
            - Bundle size impact for frontend changes

            **Architecture & Maintainability:**
            - Component reusability and composition
            - Service layer organization (music theory engines)
            - API design and error handling
            - Documentation for complex music theory concepts

            Be constructive and provide specific suggestions. Consider both technical excellence and educational impact for music theory learning.
